# Vic20
Vic20 Keyboard Project

Made to use a Commodore Vic-20 keyboard as a USB keyboard.  Current iteration uses Teensy 2.0++ hardware
to do all the heavy lifting.  PCB originally made with Eagle, but latest iterations use KiCAD.  Gerber
files are output with KiCAD to be easily interpreted by users of alternate programs.
